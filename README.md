## Generations

The Volkswagen Tiguan has gone through three generations since its introduction:

- **First Generation (2007-2016)**: The original Tiguan was built on Volkswagen's PQ35 platform shared with the Golf Mk5. It featured a range of turbocharged four-cylinder engines including both gasoline (TSI) and diesel (TDI) options. Available in both front-wheel drive and 4MOTION all-wheel drive configurations, the first-generation Tiguan combined compact dimensions with SUV versatility. A facelift in 2011 brought revised styling, improved engines, and additional technology features. This generation established the Tiguan as one of Volkswagen's most popular compact SUVs globally.

- **Second Generation (2016-2023)**: Built on the more modern MQB platform, the second-generation Tiguan grew significantly in size and offered a long-wheelbase variant (Tiguan Allspace/Tiguan L) in some markets with optional third-row seating. Engine options continued with improved turbocharged four-cylinder units, with power outputs ranging from 110 to 240 horsepower. This generation featured significantly upgraded technology including digital instrument clusters, advanced driver assistance systems, and improved connectivity. A mid-cycle refresh in 2020 introduced updated styling and a plug-in hybrid variant (eHybrid) in some markets.

- **Third Generation (2023-present)**: The latest Tiguan continues on an evolved MQB platform with a renewed focus on electrification. It features a redesigned exterior, more spacious interior, and Volkswagen's latest MIB3 infotainment system. Engine options include various turbocharged gasoline and diesel engines, plus expanded electrified powertrains including mild hybrid and plug-in hybrid variants with increased electric range. This generation emphasizes digital technology, connectivity, and semi-autonomous driving capabilities while maintaining the practical versatility that has made the Tiguan successful.
