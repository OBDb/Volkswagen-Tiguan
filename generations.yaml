    description: "The first-generation Volkswagen Tiguan was introduced as the brand's entry into the compact SUV segment. Built on the PQ35 platform shared with the Golf, it combined the practicality of an SUV with car-like handling characteristics. The exterior featured Volkswagen's then-current design language with a squared-off appearance and distinctive grille. Engine options varied by market but generally included various TSI petrol and TDI diesel engines ranging from 1.4 to 2.0 liters, with power outputs from approximately 120 to 200 horsepower. Transmission options included manual and automatic, with both front-wheel drive and 4MOTION all-wheel drive configurations available. The interior offered a functional, well-built cabin with high-quality materials for its class. A facelift in 2011 updated the styling to align with Volkswagen's newer models, featuring revised front and rear fascias. The first-generation Tiguan proved popular globally, establishing Volkswagen as a competitor in the rapidly growing compact SUV segment."

  - name: "Second Generation"
    start_year: 2017
    end_year: 2023
    description: "The second-generation Tiguan represented a significant evolution, growing in size and moving upmarket. Built on Volkswagen's modular MQB platform, it offered both standard and long-wheelbase (sold as Tiguan Allspace or Tiguan L depending on market) versions, with the latter providing optional third-row seating. The design featured sharper lines, a wider stance, and more premium detailing than its predecessor. Engine options again varied by market but typically included 1.4 to 2.0-liter TSI petrol and TDI diesel engines, with power ranging from approximately 125 to 230 horsepower. Most markets received a choice of manual or DSG dual-clutch automatic transmissions and front or 4MOTION all-wheel drive. The interior offered significant improvements in material quality, technology, and space, featuring available digital instrumentation, larger infotainment screens, and enhanced driver assistance systems. A facelift in 2020 brought styling updates, new infotainment systems, and expanded driver assistance features. This generation successfully positioned the Tiguan as one of Volkswagen's global best-sellers, offering near-premium features in the mainstream compact SUV segment."

    description: "The third-generation Tiguan, revealed in 2023 for the 2024 model year, builds upon the success of its predecessor while incorporating Volkswagen's latest design language and technology. Still based on an evolved version of the MQB platform, it maintains similar dimensions to the second generation but features a more streamlined, aerodynamic exterior with a sloping hood, sleeker LED lighting elements, and a more sophisticated overall appearance. The interior represents a significant upgrade with a minimalist dashboard dominated by a standard 12.9-inch or optional 15-inch central touchscreen and a 10.25-inch digital instrument cluster, with most physical buttons replaced by touch surfaces. Powertrain options include upgraded versions of familiar TSI and TDI engines, plus new plug-in hybrid options with electric ranges of up to 100 kilometers. Advanced driver assistance systems have been expanded to include Travel Assist with swarm data capabilities and improved automated parking features. The third-generation Tiguan aims to maintain its position as a cornerstone of Volkswagen's global lineup by offering premium technology and features in a versatile compact SUV package."
