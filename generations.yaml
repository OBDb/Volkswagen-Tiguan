generations:
  - name: "First Generation"
    start_year: 2007
    end_year: 2018
    description: "The first-generation Volkswagen Tiguan was introduced as the brand's entry into the compact SUV segment. Built on the PQ46 platform (not PQ35 as commonly believed), it combined the practicality of an SUV with car-like handling characteristics. The exterior featured Volkswagen's then-current design language with a squared-off appearance and distinctive grille. Engine options varied by market but generally included various TSI petrol and TDI diesel engines ranging from 1.4 to 2.0 liters, with power outputs from approximately 120 to 200 horsepower. Transmission options included manual and automatic, with both front-wheel drive and 4MOTION all-wheel drive configurations available. The interior offered a functional, well-built cabin with high-quality materials for its class. A facelift in 2012 updated the styling to align with Volkswagen's newer models, featuring revised front and rear fascias, bolder headlights, and updated interior trim. The first-generation Tiguan proved popular globally, establishing Volkswagen as a competitor in the rapidly growing compact SUV segment. Production continued until 2018 globally, and until 2020 in China where it was sold as the Tiguan Silk Road."

  - name: "Second Generation"
    start_year: 2016
    end_year: null
    description: "The second-generation Tiguan represented a significant evolution, growing in size and moving upmarket. Built on Volkswagen's modular MQB A2 platform, it offered both standard short-wheelbase and long-wheelbase (sold as Tiguan Allspace or Tiguan L depending on market) versions, with the latter providing optional third-row seating. The design featured sharper lines, a wider stance, and more premium detailing than its predecessor. Engine options again varied by market but typically included 1.4 to 2.0-liter TSI petrol and TDI diesel engines, with power ranging from approximately 125 to 245 horsepower. Most markets received a choice of manual or DSG dual-clutch automatic transmissions and front or 4MOTION all-wheel drive. The interior offered significant improvements in material quality, technology, and space, featuring available digital instrumentation, larger infotainment screens, and enhanced driver assistance systems. A facelift in 2020 brought styling updates including new headlamps, radiator grille, and a new multifunction digital steering wheel, along with updated MIB3 infotainment software and the IQ.Drive safety suite. Variants include the performance-oriented Tiguan R (2020+) and the coupe-style Tiguan X (China, 2020+). This generation successfully positioned the Tiguan as one of Volkswagen's global best-sellers and the best-selling SUV in Europe."

  - name: "Third Generation"
    start_year: 2024
    end_year: null
    description: "The third-generation Tiguan, unveiled in June 2023 and launched in 2024 for the 2024 model year, builds upon the success of its predecessor while incorporating Volkswagen's latest design language and technology. Based on the MQB Evo platform, it maintains similar dimensions to the second generation but features a more streamlined, aerodynamic exterior with a sloping hood, sleeker LED lighting elements, and a more sophisticated overall appearance. The interior represents a significant upgrade with a minimalist dashboard dominated by a standard 12.9-inch or optional 15-inch central touchscreen and a 10.25-inch digital instrument cluster, with most physical buttons replaced by touch surfaces. Powertrain options include upgraded versions of familiar TSI and TDI engines, plus new plug-in hybrid options with electric ranges of up to 100 kilometers. Advanced driver assistance systems have been expanded to include Travel Assist with swarm data capabilities and improved automated parking features. In China, this generation is marketed as the Tiguan L Pro with longer wheelbase and body length. In North America, it's nearly identical to the Chinese-market Tayron L. The third-generation Tiguan aims to maintain its position as a cornerstone of Volkswagen's global lineup by offering premium technology and features in a versatile compact SUV package."
